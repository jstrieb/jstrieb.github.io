<p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<p>I am indeed still a student – currently finishing my junior year at Carnegie Mellon, though I started browsing HN in the middle of high school. (In fact, I’m in the midst of finals right now, which is the reason for the delayed response.)</p>
<p>Put simply, I think Hacker News is pretty great. It has benefited me personally and professionally, though I have mixed feelings about the comments. I browse it frequently because it tends to have the best content related to my interests, so I have developed a lot of opinions about the site. What follows is my attempt to distill these as much as possible.</p>
<p>Hacker News’ greatest virtue for me is that it has helped me figure out what I haven’t yet learned, enabling me to fill in the gaps. Growing up, I lacked access to computer science/programming mentorship. My public high school had no computer science course, and before college I did not know anyone in the tech industry. I’d been programming since I was young, but there were gaps in my knowledge I didn’t know existed. HN allowed me to tap into the collective vocabulary of mathematicians, computer scientists, and tech workers. To this day, this vocabulary guides my learning – words I do not understand become targets for further investigation. Moreover, my enhanced vocabulary eases reading documentation and searching for solutions while coding. The positive influence of HN on my understanding of technical language cannot be overstated, nor can the benefits of using technical language while developing software, doing research, and communicating with technical people.</p>
<p>My regular readership likewise enabled me to contextualize much of what I’m now learning about in formal math and computer science classes. For example, systems programming is more interesting and fulfilling for me than for many of my peers because reading extensively about programming and computer history has made seemingly-arbitrary, historic programming conventions feel natural. Broad exposure to technical topics – facilitated by the overwhelming quantity of high quality content available on Hacker News – has ignited my passion and honed my intuition. Conversely, taking advanced classes has tangibly enriched the experience of browsing the site.</p>
<p>Beyond keeping me current on the latest and greatest in tech, Hacker News has been a boon for me professionally. Last summer, I had a productive, fun, and informative internship experience working at an early-stage Silicon Valley consumer robotics startup founded by YCombinator alumni. We got into contact via YCombinator’s “Work at a Startup” program, which I learned about through Hacker News. This summer, I will be interning for a security company that I initially reached out to based on a Hacker News “Who is Hiring” thread. I am confident that I would not have access to these experiences if I did not have HN as a means to find opportunities. I use my university’s on-campus career services, but they are not equipped to help students find opportunities at startups the way that Hacker News – and more broadly, YCombinator – is.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I feel jaded about tech work before I have even begun. I am passionate about enriching society using software, so it feels inevitable that I will eventually enter the tech industry in some capacity. Reading others’ critical anecdotes can therefore make me uneasy about potentially unpleasant, seemingly ineluctable professional experiences (e.g. ethically tenuous companies, “toxic environments,” management onanism, ageism, grueling hiring processes, upcoming tech bubbles, etc.), inspiring caution as I proceed. It remains to be seen whether the cynicism and apprehension borne out of reading others’ comments is for better, or for worse.</p>
<p>Reading the praise and criticism offered by commenters has also informed my understanding of best practices for tasks ranging from software development to technical writing, and has guided me to the work of role models whose skill I hope to emulate. Whether I agree or disagree with comments, they simultaneously help me to independently form my own opinions, and to understand the collective mentality of the Hacker News demographic (to the extent such a common mentality exists, anyway). Even individually unhelpful comments can be insightful in aggregate.</p>
<p>Anticipating how others will perceive my work based on this notion of a collective opinion has shaped how I present my publicly-released projects. Unfortunately, the commentary on my (admittedly limited) popular work has largely not been constructive for me, even if ensuing discussion has been interesting; I have since adjusted my expectations. I now view releasing work on Hacker News primarily as a means to quickly and broadly share projects, and only incidentally as an opportunity to solicit constructive commentary that will help me improve.</p>
<p>Despite some negative impressions, my feelings about Hacker News comments are mixed overall because, unsurprisingly, I love informative, insightful comments. In particular, there is nothing more exciting than having the author of posted content (whether OP or not) chime in with exclusive, behind-the-scenes information. However, I recognize that the number of people with a comment far outweighs the number with insight. Top comments typically contain interesting perspective rarely found anywhere else, which often supersedes less productive discussion below. Though lamenting toxicity and hypocrisy on Hacker News is common, users’ votes usually ensure it is relegated to the bottom when present. Fittingly, voters rather than commenters on Hacker News are the silent majority that tend to successfully support good content and engaging discussion.</p>
<p>Sorry this ended up being a lot to wade through! I ended up having more to say than I initially realized. I don’t have any comment on Hacker News’ moderation because frankly, it couldn’t be better! Hopefully you can extract some useful information from my impressions. At some point when I have time, I may refine these thoughts further and publish them on my website – I may even share them with the community when I do.</p>
