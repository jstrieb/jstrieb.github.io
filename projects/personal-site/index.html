<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Maintaining an Internet presence is important, and having a personal website affords me fine-grained control over mine. As the Internet becomes an increasingly integral component of modern society, controlling my own space for self-expression feels like a rite of passage for exploring and sharing important ideas. Additionally, publishing on my own platform is an opportunity to exercise my opposition to centralized social media organizations' near-monopoly on Internet-based self-expression.</p>
<p>But having a personal website is also a matter of tradition: I made my first websites when I was in second grade, after my family upgraded from dial-up to broadband Internet. At the time, my younger sister played with Barbie dolls, even though all of my friends and I agreed that &quot;Barbies stink.&quot; She was not dissuaded, so I took my case to the Web<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, surprised that the issue was not already being discussed.</p>
<p>Without knowing how to create a site from scratch, I was relegated to using drag-and-drop creators, but quickly became frustrated that they couldn't do exactly what I wanted. Ever since then, my history of website creation has been tempered by frustration with tooling: I have never been able to achieve a desirable balance between ease of publication and low-level control over layout, until now.</p>
<h2 id="static-site-generator">Static Site Generator</h2>
<p>Currently, it is popular to use static site generators like <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to publish websites. These programs compile <code>markdown</code> to <code>HTML</code> using a pre-defined theme, and they make blogging on services like <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> much easier than composing websites from scratch.</p>
<p>Inspired by my previous use of Hugo, writing pages in <code>markdown</code> has become my preferred method of authoring content for the Web, so I initially sought to make my personal site using Hugo. However, I wanted to completely customize the underlying theme, and making a theme from scratch was more trouble than creating the website entirely in <code>HTML</code>.</p>
<p>Intending to instead use something simpler and more lightweight, I next tried using <a href="http://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> with <code>make</code>. But writing targets for each new page was inconvenient, and recursively indexing the source directory never quite worked right. Since all the work of finding source files was done by shell commands in the <code>Makefile</code>, I finally resolved to write a shell script for copying and converting the files using <code>pandoc</code>.</p>
<p>Since writing the first version of the script, I have been using it to great success both on Linux, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<p>At the top of the script, there are some global variables that contain information about which directories are scanned for source files, and where the resulting output goes.</p>
<p>The script is set to exit if any step fails, since many subsequent steps rely on their predecessors, and all steps are important. Additionally, the script makes sure that <code>pandoc</code> is installed since it is necessary for the <code>markdown</code> to <code>HTML</code> conversion.</p>
<p>Next, the script uses the <code>find</code> program to index the source directory and locate all <code>markdown</code> files to be converted. It then loops over all of the files, converting them in-turn using <code>pandoc</code>. Before converting a given file, it uses <code>sed</code> to parse the base directory of the file to be converted. It uses this directory name to create the folder if it does not yet exist.</p>
<p>The script also ensures that <code>pandoc</code> conversion only happens when the resulting <code>HTML</code> output actually needs to be updated. This occurs when the destination output doesn't exist, the source file has been more recently updated than the destination output file, or when anything in the <code>resources</code> folder has been more recently updated than the destination output.</p>
<p>The <code>pandoc</code> command is run to convert from <code>markdown</code> to &quot;standalone&quot; <code>HTML</code><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This means that <code>pandoc</code> generates a full page with a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> rather than just converting to literal <code>HTML</code> tags. It also runs with options to include a custom stylesheet, to highlight code with a specific style, and to include a menu bar and footer in every page (based on files provided in the <code>resources</code> folder). The output page is formatted according to a template, also provided in the <code>resources</code> folder.</p>
<p>Next, the script copies over all files that it doesn't convert, preserving directory structure. This is useful for copying images or other media that could be associated with a post. It is also useful for copying pre-written <code>HTML</code> that the script does not generate. For example, on this site, I wrote the home page by hand in <code>HTML</code>, and copy it directly rather than converting it from <code>markdown</code>. Finally, the script removes resource files that it may have copied over, but which are junk<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a menu bar and footer. I do all <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>Javascript</code> experimentation using the <a href="https://github.com/jstrieb/urlpages">URL Pages</a> tool I created.</p>
<p>Once the menu bar and footer are made, add them to <code>resources/navbar.html</code> and <code>resources/footer.html</code>, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a main stylesheet to be used for pages on the site. Take the <code>CSS</code> code you will use and put it in <code>md/style.css</code>.</p>
<p>I design the <code>CSS</code> by playing around with different configurations using the menu bar and footer I made in the first step, and some additional example content in the middle. I also do this step in the <a href="https://jstrieb.github.io/urlpages">URL Pages Editor</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make any changes to <code>resources/template.html</code> that you see fit. Most of the variables included in that file like <code>$variable-name$</code> are defined in the preamble of <code>markdown</code> pages that are converted to <code>HTML</code>. For example, the preamble of the file for this page is as follows.</p>

<li><p>Write some <code>markdown</code> pages using any directory structure you see fit in the <code>md</code> folder. Make sure they include a preamble with all of the necessary variables, like the one shown above.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the global variables at the top of <code>compile.sh</code> so that it uses the correct source files directory, correct resources directory, and so that it has the correct output destination directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the compilation script with <code>./compile.sh</code> from the main project directory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Optional]</strong> Run a local web server such as the <code>http.server</code> module for Python 3 or <a href="https://github.com/jstrieb/quickserv">QuickServ</a> to test the site out. I typically run the following command and go to http://localhost:8080 in my browser.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">python3</span> -m http.server 8080</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>[Optional]</strong> Host your site using GitHub Pages</p></li>
